# TypeJunkie
This is the first app that I've created myself without the help of a guide or a course. 
I decided to make this project without watching any guides or courses after I finished my second course about web dev. I personally think this is the best way to learn
and it better recreates the issues that programmers face on a daily basis.

The application is besically a typing game, but instead of real words and real chapters from books, the app generates random strings of characters with random length.
I have actually played many typing games in the past to improve my typing and I was always wondering why there is no option for random strings instead of texts that you
can easily memorise.

To create the app I used HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, NODE, EXPRESS, MONGODB for the DB, google 0auth and some other modules that I can't really remember right now...
I actually know some basic ReactJS but I decided to make the app just with vanilla JS just because I wanted to challenge myself. That's actually why I didn't use 
bootstrap and some other modules that would've made my life a bit easier.
